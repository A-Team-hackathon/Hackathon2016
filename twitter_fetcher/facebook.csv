I have to keep downgrading service to keep my price where it was or pay more to keep the same service.  That is rediculous!  I started out with U450, internet and phone, then had to downgrade to U300 and lose my phone to keep the price where it was at.  Now I have to downgrade to u200 to still PAY MORE or keep it where it is and PAY A LOT MORE!  Where is the appreciation for a returning customer?  Charter is looking better and better and they will buy out my contract!!!!!

I started out with U450, internet and phone.  After that was finished, I had to downgrade to U300 and lose my phone.  Now that is finished, I can stay where I am at and go up in cost or downgrade again to U200 and STILL PAY MORE than what I just finished with!!!  Rediculous!  I do not want Direct TV!

Horrible billing system that is never right, services that are always below acceptable standards,  service techs that make you wait all day, and customer service reps that have no clue what they are talking about! The thought of you guys charging the outrageous amounts you do, hiding contract terms in tiny print, supporting your retail clerks who perform bait and switch tactics makes me sick to my stomach. My only hope is that I can find a class action law suit to join to pay the enormous early termination fees. I mean do even read the threads of other customers who are just as disgusted? I can't possibly think you do and then continue to ignore any improvement efforts.....but that's been par for the course with you.....

I regret to tell you that after many years of being a loyal and patient customer I will be dropping AT&T as well as Directv when my contract ends in January.  Something as mundane as being able to see my bill online you have not been able to achieve. Countless calls with customer service with both  AT&T as well as Directv since February of this year have gone nowhere-at least two calls a month every month since then. This among many other issues.

I pay my bills on time and have never been late. nnOn October 19, 2016 I called AT&T and spoke with customer representative Ebony. I was interested in the free IPhone 7 promotion. I understand this was for new customers so I was prepared to get another line in my plan if I had to (I was hoping there was a way around this.) Ebony advised me that the free IPhone 7 promotion was over but she could offer me another deal. Ebony offered an IPhone 7 on the Next plan at half price. She stated that I would pay tax today and after 3 months I would continue making the monthly payment but a credit would be applied monthly making the phone half price. nnEbony and I discussed this at length, confirming I would continue to be off contract and would still receive my off contract credits etc. Ebony mentioned that the 50% off promotion was not just for the IPhone but the Galaxy too. I then decided to splurge and purchase the Galaxy S7 Edge. Ebony then tried to sell me a warranty plan which I declined. I payed $63.60 tax on the Galaxy and was to receive an email for me to agree to the purchase, plan, etc. Ebony was in a large room with people talking in the background and she had a male (supervisor?) helping her set up the details with my phone number etc.nnOn October 24 I still had not received the email or phone so I called AT&T again. I did not get the CR's name but she stated that the order had been put on hold because I had not responded to the email. She also said that Ebony made a mistake and I needed to pay a $50 down payment (which I did.) she stayed on the phone and sent the email to insure I received it this time. The email came promptly to purchase a Galaxy 6 at full price on the Next plan. I told her that was completely wrong and explained the plan I agree to with Ebony. The CR sent my problem to escalation and said I would hear from someone soon.nnOn October 28 I called AT&T and spoke with CR  Kelly (very nice lady who lives in Las Vegas) who stated my problem is still in escalation and she could not find out the status because those folks "behind closed doors" don't share with CR's but someone would call me soon. nnOn October 29 I tweeted @ATTcares and @ATT to see if I could get information on my escalation. I was told (screenshots AT&T so don't deny) that it was escalated because "no plan like that exists." (Underhanded way of calling me a liar AT&T.) I was told only escalation can listen to the call of October 19 and I would have to wait until that has been investigated.nnToday is November 15 and I still have not heard from anyone at AT&T. In addition, the first payment for the phone (I don't have) is still on my bill. I understand that I am not getting the Galaxy (or any phone from them) for 50% off but I did expect to hear some sort of explanation. Did Ebony just make up the offer? If so, she worked very hard for an offer that doesn't exist. nnWe are off contract with three phones. I am considering taking my number and moving only it to another provider. AT&T you owe me an explanation and an apology! nnLong story short: AT&T offers promotion that doesn't exist. Refuses to explain.

Received a bill today for $633 for their precious equipment which was destroyed in The Great Flood of 2016. After speaking to 8 different people, in 8 different locations across the WORLD (most who had no idea about the flood.) . . AT&T said to file a claim with your insurance company. Nope, insurance isn't going to cover it - didn't have flood insurance, FEMA isn't going to cover it so I am responsible for it. REALLY AT&T? REALLY? People lost everything they own and now you're sending them a bill for your precious equipment. I hope whomever thought of this bright idea doesn't get a good night's sleep for the rest of their lives. I had been told earlier by a representative since it was a National Disaster, AT&T would write it off. Nope, three months later I get a bill. I have contacted my local television station, posted on social media, and will continue to spread the word that AT&T sucks and is a heartless company.nnThis was Uverse equipment.

The surprising thing is, MY BANK STATEMENT SHOWS OTHERWISE!!! My time has come to where I can switch providers so, SEE YA AT&THIEVES! After almost 12 years, I am cancelling my other services, outside of the mobile phone. This ignorance has taken place ALMOST EVERY MONTH FOR A YEAR! This has all been passed on to my council. Need I remind AT&T that, not too long ago, I had to be refunded almost $500 for a representative having set up a new account (when I called to modify my plan) in an effort to increase their commissions. Desperate times call for desperate measures, huh AT&T? This is ludicrous, uncalled for and unlawful (not to mention that what that rep did was a felony under Federal Law). Oh and did I mention, when I pre-maturely cancel my DIRECTV service and Internet, that I will NOT PAY A DIME FOR THE DISCONNECT FEE. NOT ONE DIME.

We have been going through the regular customer service line for 4 years now and the issues still persist.  Her phone and internet only works about 1/3 of the time, AT&T sends someone out time after time but no one can figure out the issue.  Now they removed her from her and my fathers account because he passed away years ago and they claimed she wasn't on it, which is not true, I sat with my dad when he called and had her added to the account, Twice.  They cancelled her phone number (one she has had for 40 years) and charged her $100 to do so.  She wants her number back, she lives in a rural area, she is 76 years old recent cancer survivor and lives alone.  If something happens to her and she needs to call 911 its about a 1 in 5 shot that her phone is going to work.  Someone please help, we have gone the regular customer service route for years and it just keeps getting worse!  I need her phone to work consistently, I need her internet to work consistently and I need her to have her old number back because most of her elderly friends now have no way of contacting her.  And she can't communicate with them because when she went in to AT&T a couple years ago and got a new phone they accidentally deleted all her contacts and all the photos of my recently (at the time) deceased father.  Im begging at this point, she was on the phone with customer service for hours last night after a service tech thought he fixed everything (during a 4 hour service visit) but she has no phone and no internet for the 5th time in 30 days.

It says $49.99 a month. nnThere are two ways to do business. The right way and stand by your word. And the wrong way that is extra fees and nickel and diming customers.

I often wonder how AT&T would feel if they had no service for over 112 hours over the last year. I know I didn't appreciate it. Maybe instead of AT&T stadiums you could put that money into your system so your customers could run their businesses. Novel idea!!!

This is a heartless company that ONLY cares about money. My bill is 10 days past due, I have been dealing with my mother being in & out of the ICU this past month and forgot about the bill. Did not receive any reminder of any sorts; text, email  or phone calls. Apparently, they sent me a letter in the mail that I JUST received yesterday, but hadn't had a chance to even open it yet. Called and spoke with Collections and they told me that since my services have been suspended within the hour, they can not do anything without payment in full. They sent me to the Retention dept., stating that they would be the only ones that might be able to do something to restore services and schedule a late payment. After holding for over 10 minutes, the woman I spoke to in the Retention dept. told me that there was nothing her department could do for me. So, I got juggled back to Collections to speak with a Supervisor and was put on hold for about another 10 minutes. After all of this time, I was told that there was nothing they could do. Talk about a heartless, money-hungry company. I am not one of their customers that pays them a measly $100/mo.; I pay over $700/mo for phones and services. If they treat me like this, I can imaging how they would treat someone that only has 1 line with them.

We went to the local store to inquire about it and even told the sales girl that we might switch carriers if AT&T didn't have a plan right for us. AT&T couldn't offer us a good plan so we ended up switching carriers. The girl at the store NEVER once mentioned that were still in contract and because we kept getting message that we could upgrade, we didn't think we were in contract. We were hit with a $280 early termination fee because apparently we have 2 months left in our "contract" with them. When you get messages saying you are eligible for an upgrade and 2 customer service girls at your local store don't mention you are still in contract, that is very misleading. I am so tired of good, long term consumers who pay their bills on time, getting the short end of the stick and these large companies making money off of us. I'm ok with an early termination fee because it is our error but my goodness, $280 for only 2 months left of our contract????? Come on AT&T.

I have never been as upset or disrespected as I have from AT&T wireless as I have this past two months, but really this past week. I was hung up on by 3 different supervisors today. I have 3 lines of business with you under a business account. I am in the process of switching carriers. I pay $200 minimum for 2 cellular phones and a WiFi hotspot for the laptops and iPads every month. I've always had an account in good standing. Now, because of a defective Samsung Galaxy S7 that was overheating and shutting down or freezing up, it actually burned the palm of my hand, I am being charged for a device that I shipped back when I received the replacement. I was told by 3 different supervisors that the cost of the defective phone was in dispute and I would not be charged a late fee, have services interrupted during this time. This is not the case. I had to fight for almost three hours, made three separate phone calls in as I was being hung up on or transferred to other departments with being told I was being transferred today. I had to cancel a medical procedure I had scheduled today because I had to get my services restored. I called 611 from my phone, it said I could make a payment, but there is no way to transfer to a billing rep. This is a tad bit ludicrous. Your customer service support has become a laughing stock. I will never recommend AT&T to anyone. You've lost a long time, extremely loyal customer that was a customer before Cingular took over. When a supervisor lies flat out and says there is nobody else that I can talk to, and then when I asked "you don't report to anyone?" He quickly back peddled and said well yes I do, then restored my services until the 25th to see if the defective phone shows up, there is a problem. The tower on the corner of Walnut St and 19th St in Everett, WA is poor in signal and has been since August 2015 to where I have to use my WiFi from Comcast in order to boost a signal to make and receive calls, send texts because there is no signal. That is unacceptable. I've replaced the phone and the SIM. It's not on my side, yet I still have paid my bill. Either that returned piece of defective garbage that I mailed back on August 29th, is removed from my account permanently or I am gone as a customer forever. Also I have filed a complaint with the Washington state Attorney General's office, the BBB, FCC and the next step is the media.

The customer service that I have received in the past two days has been atrocious. Yesterday, I was on the phone for HOURS trying to activate our new phones. We let the agent know that one of the phones would be activated today. Everything seemed to be fine after dealing with multiple people on the phone and being disconnected at least once yesterday. Tonight was a different story. We called the get the last phone activated and all of a sudden, no one could help us. I was transferred multiple times, disconnected TWICE and was spoken down to as if I was stupid. The last phone is still NOT activated and the agent claims that she will be calling me back tomorrow. Multiple departments had to be contacted and the agent ran my credit score two times. If this does not get resolved, I will bring my business to a company who actually cares about their customers.

1479175675000,8576093908_10154728097383909,null,Allen Bascomb,null,0,So after a decade with Verizon my wife and I actually decided to take a leap of faith and change to AT&T. Was hoping and praying that it would be smooth and all would go well. I am sad to say that all of our worries are completely justified and it is like a horror movie at the moment. 1 order that I was told would be processed a dozen times still isn't processed, the new order to replace that went through and we got those devices and lines activated. Finally after 12 days of trying to give AT&T my money and service they finally took it. That is not the end unfortunately. The first order was supposed to have been canceled on 3 occasions but still isn't. The $188 in taxes still charged according to them and still not able to port my lines over because of the order sitting there that I was told with 100% certainty by 6 people was being processed. So I sit here getting charged by AT&T and Verizon. Verizon's customer service was the pitts, but hell, they never had an issue with taking my money or adding services so I cringe thinking about what AT&T service will be like if this is what you get when trying to buy something. Very glad that I actually have 14 days to decide to just stick with Verizon because the display of incompetence I have seen so far is mind boggling. Now I'm told 24-48 hours and it will be taken care of, yeah, I'm still waiting for that first 24 hour promise to take place 11 days later. If I don't get contacted and resolution soon they can kids this customer goodbye and that includes the DirecTV service I have had over 10 years.

It all started two months ago when my phone went off contract.  It just so happened that we didn’t need my wife’s phone any longer so I called to drop the second line (hers).  I was told that her line had two months left on contract and that it couldn’t be cancelled.  So, even though my phone was off contract we were still locked into paying for two lines of service even though only one phone was under contract.  Hardly seems right, but I waited the two months for the phone to go off contract and called today to cancel the service.  Now I’m told that they will NOT pro-rate bills.  So, I can turn the second line off, but still have to pay for the cost of the remaining 3 weeks on the bill cycle… WHAT!!!??!!  How do you possibly justify charging customers for unused service??  I’ve already given you crooks two months of fees while not even using the phone.  This seems like a matter for the FCC.  I will be filing a complaint by end of week unless my money gets refunded.

I tried their services and am glad to say I went back to Verizon Wireless because AT&T's customer service is horrible. From the point I signed up with them via web I was lied to about the plan discounts and overall cost of the switch. I dealt with several service "specialists" as soon as I realized I was lied to to switch. Each time I was told the problem would be fixed. After days of calling and dealing with new people and explaining the problems for hours daily I canceled services. I reported them to the BBB and was contacted by a Wallace Phelps with the Office of the President Intake. I was assured by him the outrageous $1700 bill for 11 days of cell service would be taken care. We agreed upon $40 as my bill for services. I paid that and was told credits would post and my account was done. I have been trying to contact Wallace Phelps via email at Wp1642@att.com and phone at 228) 819-6304. I have also spent hours speaking again with brand new agents at ATT to try and resolve this issue. I have had no luck so I guess the only way to get someone at AT&T to respond is to go to the BBB. I have never had this sort of issue with Verizon!

Called for them to send a new one and never received an email verifying my order, nor did I receive the new wireless receiver when I was told I would get it Saturday!  It's Monday evening and I still have no receiver and the lady I was on hold with to speak to a manager hung up on me!!! I will gladly take my business elsewhere!
1479169975000,8576093908_10154727709828909,null,Larry Jennings,null,0,I have had Direct TV for over 20 years and for most of that time there wasn't much I could complain about. ATT purchased Direct TV  sometime this year and since I have had nothing but problems. The continually add services to my account that I never ask for and I have to call to get taken off and credited back money. Some of these like NFL package seems to come back every month like they are trying to slip it by. In was over charged 125.00 in September, 250.00 in October and 319.00 in November.  I'm about fed up with ATT. When I had everything taken care of Friday for the November Bill they said everything was paid up. Today they shut off service and I spent 2 hours on phone to get things straightened out one again. Yet one again when service restored I had NFL package again and had to call to get off my account. I wish ATT would stick to phones and leave my TV alone. #ATTSUCKS IN MY OPINION. Please share and pass on if you agree.

1479169003000,8576093908_10154727643218909,null,Matt Eppright,null,0,AT&T I've been with AT&T for over 15 years, I was denied a manufactures warranty on a $900 phone today after talking in person and to the retention department.  Phone doesn't charge properly, drops networks, wifi is completely broken.  Apparently a 6 month old small crack in the glass (not the screen itself) invalidates the warranty due to AT&T policy, not the actual manufacture's warranty text.  Do no buy a phone from AT&T, get it somewhere else with a better understanding of what warranty is.  Moving on to a new carrier. . . .

One computer is pretty much the same as another.nn"Oh no! We deeply apologize for the bad experience you're experiencing,"n"Hey Mr xxx! "n"Hi xxxyyy! We apologize for the delay with your new activation"n"Hey xxxx. We understand the apprehensiveness."n"Thanks xxxx for reaching out to us with your concerns. I do apologize for any inconvenience or frustration this may have causes you."

Looking through other customers posts makes me even more upset that they are doing this to other people.. Every time I call in, empty promises and passing the problem onto the next person, so it never gets resolved. Feels like I am just getting taken advantage of and there is nothing I can do to stop it.. Sick to my stomach that a company could treat people like this.

She took the time to review the details and the case in its entirety and make things happen in order to do the right, ethical thing and to prove that there is integrity still in customer service ... This is something that was not shown by every single phone CSR and Supervisor up to this point ... I am so relieved to have resolve and that the right course of action was taken ... Again, three cheers for Yazmin M and all of the hard work that she does in a kind, courteous, professional manner!!! ... Thank you again for everything!!!
